SUMMARY

The purpose of the app is to increase political engagement throughout the year, not just at election time. Users will be alerted with push notifications when a bill of interest is coming up for vote, and provided with an option to call the elected representative's office to express an opinion on the bill. Additionally, the app could track opinions on bills and the representative's votes for comparison at election time.

MOTIVATION

The most effective way to communicate with your elective representative is call their district office \(see this article for instance, but also ask any advocacy organization and they will tell you the same\). In the week after the election, you may have seen the “We’re His Problem Now” Calling Sheet Google doc. This, along with a suggestion that going forward, it is incumbent on all citizens to pay very close attention to the bills before congress, gave me an idea to create an app that will give and automatic call to action when a bill of interest is coming up for a vote.

DETAILS

Users could choose areas of interest, and when bills covering those areas come up, they would get an alert that includes some bulleted summary points about the bill, and the phone numbers for their representatives \(ideally with a "call now" button\). I was thinking it could include talking points/script like the call to action, but those would be biased, so that might be tricky. Also there should be a follow-up notification on how the representatives vote. The user could even enter their preferred vote in the app, then the app can track how well the representative votes in line with the users’ preferences; this would provide a great reference at election time. But my main goal is to make it easier to watch and reach out to elected officials to promote year-round engagement with the push notifications to call the district office.

RESOURCES

The Sunlight foundation offers APIs for activity in congress and in state legislatures which could potentially be utilized.

IssueVoter offers a nice interface for tracking the votes of congressional representatives and a summary of bills, including arguments for and against the bills. We could potentially reach out to the founder of this site for a collaboration, but I am troubled by a couple aspects of this site. First of all, they claim to send along your opinions \(support or oppose\) on the bills to the congressperson, but there is no transparency in that communication. Also, putting together the summaries and arguments for the site takes a fair amount of labor, and it is not clear to me how they have the resources for the labor. Are they planning on monetizing the site somehow? What kind of bias might the research interns have?

CHALLENGES

Categorizing the bills according to topical area and providing summaries automatically may be beyond our capabilities. Providing a call script would be super useful, but also problematic as it would require human-intervention to write.
