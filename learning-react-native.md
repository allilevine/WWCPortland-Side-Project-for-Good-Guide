## Learning React

This is a good resource for starting to learn React without having to actually install anything: [How I Learned React and How You Can Too](https://medium.com/@sgroff04/how-i-learned-react-and-how-you-can-too-6714a48e984a#.ogos5gcbi) It links to parts of the React documentation and tutorials / classes that are especially helpful.
